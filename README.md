This was my final project for CSE308- Software Engineering. It used Java EE (JSP, Servlets, JPA) and front end technologies such as JSTL, Javascript (AJAX, and JQuery). 

### What is Cinemango? ###

* Cinemango is a reverse engineered java EE web application version of the Fandango website. It is a movie ticket purchasing site with many movies, theaters and showtimes at these theaters. 
* Final Version

### How do I get set up? ###

* Clone the project and make sure you have the JPA, java mail zip files. If you're using tomcat make sure you have the necessary zip file for running core JSTL. 
* Database configuration: This project uses a MYSQL server (remote from Stony Brook University) and requires the JDBC.
