            <p><strong>Your use of our Site or other Service is subject to binding individual arbitration of any disputes which may arise, as provided in Paragraph 18 below.

            <h3><b>ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</b></h3>
            <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") set forth the terms and conditions that apply to your use of www.cinemango.com or any of our other websites (collectively, the "Site") and any other services or products and any related software applications (collectively, the "Service") offered and/or operated by Cinemango, LLC ("Cinemango" or "we" or "our" or "us"). By visiting our Site or otherwise signing up for and/or using our Service, you agree that you have read, understand and agree to be legally bound by these Terms.<p>

Your continued use or accessing of the Site or other Service following the posting of any changes to the Terms constitutes your acceptance of such changes. To the extent that an arbitrator or court of applicable jurisdiction determines that applying any changes to these Terms would render this an illusory or unenforceable contract, such changes shall be applicable on a prospective basis only, with respect to events or circumstances occurring after the date of such changes, to the extent necessary to avoid these Terms being deemed illusory or unenforceable.</p>
